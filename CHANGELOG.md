# Changelog

All notable changes to Office Ninja Pro are documented here.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release includes a summary of what changed and why.

## [3.2.0] — December 9, 2025

This release introduces two major features that transform Office Ninja Pro from a simple dimmer into a complete workplace privacy suite.

### New Features

**Tab Disguise**

You can now instantly camouflage your tab to look like a productive Google app. Click one button and your manga site becomes "Q4 Budget Analysis - Google Sheets" — complete with a matching favicon.

Available disguises:
- Google Sheets (looks like a spreadsheet)
- Gmail (looks like your inbox)
- Google Docs (looks like meeting notes)
- Google Calendar (looks like a team sync)

This works by modifying `document.title` and dynamically swapping the favicon element. The original tab info is saved so you can restore it with one click.

**Decoy Tabs**

Configure which "work" tabs should auto-open when you trigger panic mode. Previously, the Boss Key just opened a single Google Doc. Now it can open Gmail, Sheets, Calendar, and Drive as background tabs — creating an instant productivity alibi.

Settings are found in the Options page. Enable the feature, check which tabs you want, and the next time you press `Alt+Shift+B`, you'll have a full arsenal of open work tabs.

### Code Quality

We did a complete refactor of the entire codebase:

- Rewrote all JavaScript with natural, human-readable comments
- Replaced generic variable names with descriptive ones
- Added clear section headers to organize long files
- Improved error handling throughout
- Made the code portfolio-ready

The extension now looks like it was written by a thoughtful developer, not generated by a template.

### Technical Details

- New message actions: `APPLY_DISGUISE`, `REMOVE_DISGUISE`, `GET_DISGUISE_STATUS`
- New storage schema for `decoySettings`
- Added disguise status indicator to popup
- Updated manifest to version 3.2

## [3.0.0] — December 9, 2025

A ground-up redesign. Version 3.0 reimagines Office Ninja Pro as a premium privacy tool with a modern interface and powerful features.

### Complete UI Overhaul

The popup got a dramatic makeover:
- Dark theme with subtle glassmorphism effects
- Animated gradient title that catches the eye
- Smooth slider interactions with gradient tracks
- Apple-inspired toggle switches
- Card-based layout that groups related controls

Everything feels polished and premium now.

### Quick Presets

For users who don't want to fiddle with individual settings, we added three one-click presets:

- **Night Mode** — 60% dim, 2px blur. Good for dark environments.
- **Focus Mode** — 40% dim, 5px blur, grayscale on. Reduces visual distraction.
- **Office Stealth** — 80% dim, 3px blur. Maximum privacy.

### Color Themes

The overlay isn't limited to black anymore. Choose from:
- Black (default)
- Midnight Blue
- Forest Green
- Sepia

Each option gives a different vibe while maintaining the dimming effect.

### Per-Site Settings

Different sites, different needs. Enable the per-site toggle and your settings are saved for that specific domain. YouTube might be at 70% dim while GitHub stays at 30%.

Settings are stored in `chrome.storage.sync`, so they follow you to other devices.

### Floating Widget

A small draggable button appears on every page, giving you quick access to controls without opening the popup. Click it to reveal a mini control panel with dim, blur, and grayscale adjustments.

The widget remembers its position via localStorage.

### Boss Key

Press `Alt+Shift+B` and a new Google Doc immediately opens. It's your emergency escape when someone walks up unexpectedly.

### Usage Statistics

The Options page now shows:
- Total time spent with stealth mode active
- Today's stealth time
- This week's usage
- Total session count

Good for awareness, or just satisfying your curiosity.

### Architecture Changes

The codebase was reorganized:

```
popup/     → All popup-related files together
content/   → Content script and widget styles
background/ → Service worker
options/   → Settings page
utils/     → Shared storage utilities
icons/     → Extension icons at different sizes
```

All CSS was extracted from HTML files. No more inline styles.

## Upgrade Notes

**Upgrading to 3.2:**
Your existing settings will be preserved. New features (Tab Disguise, Decoy Tabs) will be disabled by default. Enable them in the popup or Options page when you're ready.

**Upgrading to 3.0:**
Due to the storage schema changes, some very old settings might not migrate. If your settings seem reset, just reconfigure them — it only takes a moment.
